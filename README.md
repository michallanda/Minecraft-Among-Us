# Among Us: Minecraft Edition
A recreation of the popular game, Among Us, but recreated for a Spigot Minecraft Server!

This is a work-in-progress plugin, that only gets updated when I have the time to work on it.

## Current Features

### Lobby Creation

A game lobby can be created by running the /lobby command. This will put the player in a lobby, where you would wait for others to join. There's functionality to leave, and start the game which would spawn you in the map.

### Tasks

Some tasks have been coded in, like wires, which users would be thrown into when going up to specific locations with the map.

Wires works by putting the player into a seperate area with a wall tens of blocks away, where the playey can use their cursor to drag the wires.

Camera functionality was also added in partially, and players can view certain areas of the map through a "camera" without the other players knowing they are viewing. 

### Imposter 

Venting has been coded in, where an imposter would be able to stand over a vent, enter the vent, and view the near by area while in the vent. They are also able to switch vents in certain directions and view those vents as well as leave the vent.
